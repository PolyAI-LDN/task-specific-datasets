# NLU++

*A Multi-Label, Slot-Rich, Generalisable Dataset for Natural Language Understanding in Task-Oriented Dialogue*


This dataset presents a challenging evaluation environment for dialogue NLU models. It is divided in 2 domains, 
_banking_ and _hotels_, and provides high quality examples combining a large amount of _multi-label_ intents and slots. 
More details on the dataset can be found in [our publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13021).

| Domain  | Number of examples               |   Number of intents   | Number of slots  |
| ---            |   --- | --- |--- |
| BANKING | 2,071 | 48 | 13 |
| HOTELS | 1,009  | 40 | 14 |
| ALL | 3,080 | 62 | 17 |



|          Example Query      | Intents      | Slots (values)      |
| ---            |   --- |--- |
| I want to change my restaurant reservation| change, booking, room | --- |
| I am trying to make a transfer but it doesn’t let me | make, transfer_payment, not_working | --- |
| Why can’t I amend my booking on tuesday? | why, change, booking, not_working | date (tuesday) |
| How much less did I spend on Amazon during the current year? | how_much, less, transfer_payment  | date_period (current year), company_name (Amazon)|
| Can I make a reservation from the 1st of June to the 7th? | make, booking | date_from (1st of June), date_to (7th) |

## Data structure

The data is divided in 2 domains, _banking_ and _hotels_, each of it in their corresponding directories. 
The data for each of these domains is divided in 20 folds, each of them in a json file named `fold0.json`,
`fold1.json`, etc. The structure of each example is the following:
```json
{
    "text": "How much did I spend in total until May on amazon prime?",
    "intents": [
      "how_much",
      "transfer_payment_deposit"
    ],
    "slots": {
      "date_to": {
        "text": "May",
        "span": [
          36,
          39
        ],
        "value": {
          "day": 31,
          "month": 5,
          "year": 2022
        }
      },
      "company_name": {
        "text": "amazon prime",
        "span": [
          43,
          55
        ],
        "value": "amazon prime"
      }
    }
  }

```

Where the intents (or intent modules) are defined as a list in the field 
`"intents"` and the slot-values in the field `"slots"`. If any of the fields is missing,
then it means that the example has no intents or slot-values. For each slot present, the 
span is defined in the field `"span"` and the canonical value is defined in the field `"value"`.
For relative dates and times, the reference date is set to `2022/3/15` and the 
reference time is set to `09:00 a.m.`, e.g.:

```json
{
    "text": "today",
    "slots": {
      "date": {
        "text": "today",
        "span": [
          0,
          5
        ],
        "value": {
          "day": 15,
          "month": 3,
          "year": 2022
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

```json
{
    "text": "any table free in 2 hours?",
    "intents": [
      "request_info",
      "restaurant",
      "booking"
    ],
    "slots": {
      "time": {
        "text": "in 2 hours",
        "span": [
          15,
          25
        ],
        "value": {
          "hour": 11,
          "minute": 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

The values of relative weekdays will be considered to be in the future, e.g.:

```json
{
    "text": "I'm leaving on Wednesday",
    "slots": {
      "date_to": {
        "text": "Wednesday",
        "span": [
          15,
          24
        ],
        "value": {
          "day": 16,
          "month": 3,
          "year": 2022
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## Experimental setup

For the experiments presented in the paper we adopt 3 data setups:
* **20-fold**: (or "low") We use 1 fold for training and the other 19 folds for testing, doing this 20 times with a different training fold. Then we report the mean results of each fold.
* **10-fold**: (or "mid") We use 2 folds for training and the other 18 folds for testing, doing this 10 times with 10 pairs of training folds. We use consecutive indices for the training pairs (i.e. `fold0.json` and `fold1.json`, `fold2.json` and `fold3.json`, etc.). Then we report the mean results for each pair of folds.
* **Large**: We use 18 folds for training and the other two for testing, doing this 10 times with 10 pairs of testing folds. This can be seen as "inverse" 10-fold.

These setups are designed to replicate the data setups found in production while not overfitting to a small test set.

We also use 3 domain setups:
* **BANKING**: We train and test on banking data only.
* **HOTELS**: We train and test on hotels data only.
* **ALL**: We train and test on both domains. The folds for each domain are joined for the different data setups (i.e. banking/fold0.json will be joined with hotels/fold0.json and so on)

We provide the code to easily load all these setups in `data_loader.py`, e.g.

```python
from nlupp.data_loader import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader("<PATH_TO_NLUPP_DATA>")
banking_low = loader.get_data_for_experiment(domain="banking", regime="low")
```

in this example, the method will return a dictionary with the data already 
structured for the 20-fold BANKING experiments, i.e.
```
banking_low = {
  0: {"train": train examples_for_fold_0,
      "test": test_examples_for_fold_0},
  1: {"train": train examples_for_fold_1,
      "test": test_examples_for_fold_1},
  ...,
  19: {"train": train examples_for_fold_19,
      "test": test_examples_for_fold_19}
  }
```
The method can be called with `domain = "banking", "hotels" or "all"` and 
`regime = "low", "mid" or "large"`

To replicate the experiments, simply train 1 model per fold with the returned 
train-test splits and report the average results.

We also perform additional _cross-domain_ experiments, in where we train the
models on all the data from one of the domains, and we test it in the generic
intents of the other domain. To get the cross domain data, pass either 
`"banking-hotels"` or `"hotels-banking"` as `domain` argument (with no `regime` arg), e.g.:
```python
banking_hotels = loader.get_data_for_experiment(domain="banking-hotels")
```

Which will return
```
banking_hotels = {
  0: {"train": all_banking_examples,
      "test": all_hotels_examples},
  }
```

Note that in this case a single fold is returned. Also, all the non generic 
intents and slots are removed from the annotations.
